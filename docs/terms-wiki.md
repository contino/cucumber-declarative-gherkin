# Organization and Industry Terms Wiki

This wiki contains the term definitions used by the organization and industry.
Product teams use this wiki to clarify terms in declarative Gherkin.  In
addition, it contains the organization's limits and constraints related to
each term.  Example, what is the acceptable credit score for a credit
application.

The wiki requires versioning, so work tickets can reference a specific
version of the wiki page.  It is better to reference a wiki version, as it is
a source of truth.  Copying terms, definitions and calculations into a ticket
is error prone and does not support traceability.  

## Back-end Ratio

Back-end ratio definition from Credit.org:
“The sum of your monthly mortgage payment and all other monthly debts (credit
cards, car payments, student loans, etc.) divided by your monthly pre-tax
income. Traditionally, lenders wouldn’t give people loans that increased this
ratio past 36%, but they often do now. “

Acceptable back-end ratio is 36% or less.  Anything higher is a not acceptable.

## Credit Score

Definition from <https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/c/credit-score/>
A credit score is a number that represents a person’s creditworthiness. Credit
scores are based on a variety of personal financial data. Higher credit scores
correlate with better creditworthiness. Financial institutions judge people
with higher credit scores to have lower credit risk, and grant them a broader
selection of credit products at lower interest rates. Fair Issac Corp. (FICO)
and VantageScore Solutions are the two leading U.S. credit scoring companies.

Our acceptable rate is 661 or greater.
